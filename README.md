```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
# ... (import other necessary libraries)

# Example usage code here
```

## Dataset Preprocessing
Briefly explain the dataset preprocessing steps. Include any important details about data cleaning, filtering, or manipulation.

```python
# Dataset preprocessing code snippet
data_dir = 'dataset'
image_exts = ['jpeg','jpg', 'bmp', 'png']
# ... (other preprocessing steps)
```

## Model Architecture
Describe the architecture of your model. Include the layers, activation functions, and any other relevant details.

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... (add your model layers)
])
model.summary()
```

## Training
Provide information on how to train the model. Include details such as the choice of optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(train_data, validation_data=val_data, epochs=50)
```

## Results
Discuss the results of your project. Include any performance metrics, visualizations, or insights gained from the training process.

```python
# Example code to display training results
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label = 'val_accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.show()
```
